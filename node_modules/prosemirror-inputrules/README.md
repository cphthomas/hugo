ProseMirror is a well-behaved rich semantic content editor based on
contentEditable, with support for collaborative editing and custom
document schemas.

This [module](http://prosemirror.net/ref.html#inputrules) exports a
plugin that can be used to define _input rules_, things that should
happen when input matching a given pattern is typed, along with a
number of predefined rules.

The [project page](http://prosemirror.net) has more information, a
number of [demos](http://prosemirror.net/#demos) and the
[documentation](http://prosemirror.net/docs.html).

**NOTE:** This project is in *BETA* stage. It isn't thoroughly tested,

to use it, but don't expect it to be very stable yet.
